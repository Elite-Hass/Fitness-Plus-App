# Fitness-Plus-App
Fitness Plus is an Android app developed as part of a mobile development course project.
The goal was to create a simple and clean fitness tracker that allows users to view and manage their workout history.

## Features
- Workout history screen that displays a list of past workouts.
- Workout detail page showing workout information and an image.
- Image zoom functionality for better visibility.
- Local data storage for saving workout information.
- Responsive XML layouts designed to support multiple screen sizes.
- Simple navigation between the history and detail screens.

## My Role
I worked on:
- Designing and implementing the Workout History screen.
- Displaying past workouts in a clean, readable layout.
- Contributing to the overall UI design to ensure a simple and organized look.
